## Features

- Counts nucleotides: A, T, G, C  
- Calculates GC content (%)  
- Reads sequences from **FASTA or plain text files**  
- Generates a **pie chart** of nucleotide distribution  
- Fully runnable in **Google Colab** or any Python environment

## How to Run

### Option 1: Run in Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)  
2. Upload this notebook or paste the code  
3. Run the cells and **upload your DNA file** when prompted  
4. View GC content, base counts, and pie chart  

### Option 2: Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DNA-Sequence-Analyzer-Visualizer.git
